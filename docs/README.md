# **ESP32 Signal Control Project**

## Project Overview
This project is an **ESP32-based signal control system** designed to handle input interrupts and generate pulse waveforms. It utilizes GPIO for input buttons and output signals, with an efficient **interrupt-driven** approach to manage button presses and control LED signaling.

## Features
- **ESP32-based** real-time signal processing
- **Button interrupt handling** with debounce logic
- **Configurable pulse generation** based on selection mode
- **ESP Logging support** for debugging and monitoring
- **Custom delay implementation** for precise waveform control

## Project Structure


## Setup Instructions
